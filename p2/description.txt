PROJECT PROPOSAL:

Idea: Academy Awards Database

The objective of this project is to create a database of information on Oscar awards.
The database includes tables such as, and not limited to: 
1) table containing information on award winning actors, 
2) table on movies, 
3) table on nomination of awards, 
4) table for genre of movies,
5) table for box office ratings of movies, 
6) table for producers
7) table for technical staff


In this project, I want to use my passion for movies to collect and make sense
of data about the Academy Awards. I have always loved watching movies, and over the
lockdown I had the chance to rekindle my passion for the visual art. I believe this
project is feasible because of the wide availability of data online. Most of this 
data is available in a fragmented form, and I believe through this project I will be
able to leverage the database management skills taught in this course to tabulate
the data in a user friendly manner.

An example of the kind of interesting questions that I believe can be answered in
this project:
1) How often do academy award winners work with each other (Do they work with each 
other more often than they work with other artists, thus increasing their chances 
to win more awards in the future?)
2) Has the longevity of actors increased in the last few decades? (based solely on 
awards data, can we say anything about the career spans of actors?)
3) Does having a lot of award nominations translate to good box office revenue?

The user will be able to interact with the tables using a UI that I will build using django
framework. The user will be able to see interesting data points and graphs related to the actors 
and upon request can be shown the relationship between different tables. They will be able to
gather and accumulate all data relating to their favorite movies, actors, and production houses 
in one database.
