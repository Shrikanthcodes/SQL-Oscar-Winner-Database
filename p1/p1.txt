PROJECT PROPOSAL:

Idea: Academy Awards Database

The objective of this project is to create a database of information on Oscar awards.
The database includes tables such as, and not limited to: 
1) table containing information on award winners, 
2) table on movies, 
3) table on categories of awards, 
4) table for viewer ratings (eg. rotten tomatoes, IMDB), 
5) table for box office ratings of movies, 
6) table for award nominations
7) table containing data on genre of movies
8) table containing miscellaneous data about movies
9) tables for Technical/non-technical award categories (such as cinematography, etc)

In this project, I want to use my passion for movies to collect and make sense
of data about the Academy Awards. I have always loved watching movies, and over the
lockdown I had the chance to rekindle my passion for the visual art. I believe this
project is feasible because of the wide availability of data online. Most of this 
data is available in a fragmented form, and I believe through this project I will be
able to leverage the database management skills taught in this course to tabulate
the data in a user friendly manner.

An example of the kind of interesting questions that I believe can be answered in
this project:
1) How often do academy award winners work with each other (Do they work with each 
other more often than they work with other artists, thus increasing their chances 
to win more awards in the future?)
2) Has the longevity of actors increased in the last few decades? (based solely on 
awards data, can we say anything about the career spans of actors?)
3) Does having a lot of award nominations translate to good box office revenue?
